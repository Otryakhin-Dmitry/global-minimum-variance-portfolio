Description: Concerns the applications of the shrinkage-type methods for estimation and inference of
    high-dimensional mean-variance portfolios. Techniques developed in Bodnar et al. (2018, 2019, 
    2020, 2021) are central to the package. They provide simple and feasible estimators and tests
    for optimal portfolio weights, which are applicable for ``large p and large n'' situations, 
    where p is the portfolio dimension (number of stocks) and n is the sample size (investment 
    horizon). The package also includes tools for constructing portfolios with shrinkage means and 
    covariance matrices as well as a new Bayesian estimator for the Markowitz efficient frontier
    recently developed by Bauder et al. (2021, Quantitative Finance).
