Description: Constructs shrinkage estimators of high-dimensional mean-variance portfolios and performs 
high-dimensional tests on optimality of a given portfolio. The techniques developed in Bodnar et al. (2018) 
    <doi:10.1016/j.ejor.2017.09.028>, Bodnar et al. (2019) <doi:10.1109/TSP.2019.2929964>,
    Bodnar et al. (2020) <doi:10.1109/TSP.2020.3037369> are central to the package. They 
    provide simple and feasible estimators and tests for optimal portfolio weights, which 
    are applicable for 'large p and large n' situations where p is the portfolio dimension
    (number of stocks) and n is the sample size. The package also includes tools for 
    constructing portfolios based on shrinkage estimators of the mean vector and covariance matrix as well as a new 
    Bayesian estimator for the Markowitz efficient frontier recently developed by Bauder 
    et al. (2021) <doi:10.1080/14697688.2020.1748214>.
